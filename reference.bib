  title = {An overview on 3D printing for abdominal surgery},
  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a disruptive technology that is quickly spreading to many fields, including healthcare. In this context, it allows the creation of graspable, patient-specific, anatomical models generated from medical images. The ability to hold and show a physical object speeds up and facilitates the understanding of anatomical details, eases patient counseling and contributes to the education and training of students and residents. Several medical specialties are currently exploring the potential of this technology, including general surgery.
In this review, we provide an overview on the available 3D printing technologies, together with a systematic analysis of the medical literature dedicated to its application for abdominal surgery. Our experience with the first clinical laboratory for 3D printing in Italy is also reported.
There was a tenfold increase in the number of publications per year over the last decade. About 70% of these papers focused on kidney and liver models, produced primarily for pre-interventional planning, as well as for educational and training purposes. The most used printing technologies are material jetting and material extrusion. Seventy-three percent of publications reported on fewer than ten clinical cases.The increasing application of 3D printing in abdominal surgery reflects the dawn of a new technology, although it is still in its infancy. The potential benefit of this technology is clear, however, and it may soon lead to the development of new hospital facilities to improve surgical training, research, and patient care.},

  title = {Standard Versus Custom-Made Acetabular Implants in Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty},
  abstract = {Today, various options are used for the reconstruction of acetabular bone loss in revision total hip arthroplasty (RTHA). The aim of the study was to compare the outcomes of using standard acetabular implants (SAIs) and custom-made acetabular implants (CMAIs) in RTHA in cases with extensive acetabular bone loss.
This was a comparative analysis of the results of 106 operations of RTHA performed during the period from January 2013 to December 2019. In 61 cases (57.5%), CMAIs were used. In 45 cases (42.5%), SAIs were implanted.
The incidence of aseptic loosening of the acetabular component after RTHA in uncontained loss of bone stock of the acetabulum (type III-IV as per the Gross and Saleh classification) using the CMAI was less than that using the SAI (2.4% and 10.0%, respectively). The most significant differences in aseptic loosening rates were noted after implantation of the CMAI and SAI in pelvic discontinuity with uncontained bone defect (0% and 60.0%, respectively; P<.001).The ideal indications for the use of the CMAI are uncontained defects and pelvic discontinuity with uncontained loss of bone stock (types III-V Gross and Saleh classification). Treatment of these defects with the SAI leads to a higher incidence of aseptic loosening requiring re-revisions. Further observation is required to assess the effectiveness of using the CMAI and SAI in the long-term follow-up period.},

  abstract = {The use of 3D printing is gaining considerable success in many medical fields including surgery. Here, the technology was introduced for increasing the level of anatomical understanding thanks to the inherent characteristics of 3D printed models: these are highly accurate and customized reproductions, being obtained from own radiological imaging of patients, and are solid graspable objects allowing for free manipulation on part of the user. The resulting tactile feedbacks significantly help the comprehension of anatomical details, especially the spatial relations between structures. In this regard, they proved to be more effective than conventional 2D imaging and 3D virtual models. To date, an increasing number of applications have been successfully tested in many surgical disciplines, extending the range of possible uses to pre-operative planning, counselling with patients, education of students and residents, surgical training, intraoperative navigation and others; in recent years, 3D printing was also employed for creating surgical tools and reproducing anatomical parts to be used, respectively, as templates or guides for specific tasks of the surgery and individualized implantable materials in reconstructive procedures. Future expectations concern on one side the reduction of manufacturing costs and time to further increase the accessibility of 3D printing, while on the other the development of novel techniques and materials suitable for 3D printing of biological structures by which recreating the architecture and functionality of real human organs and tissues.},

The constantly improving quality of 3D-printing applications has contributed to their increased use on patients. This paper summarizes the literature on surgical 3D-printing applications used on patients, with a focus on reported clinical and economic outcomes.
Three major literature databases were screened for case series (more than three cases described in the same study) and trials of surgical applications of 3D printing in humans.
227 surgical papers were analyzed and summarized using an evidence table. The papers described the use of 3D printing for surgical guides, anatomical models, and custom implants. 3D printing is used in multiple surgical domains, such as orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, cranial surgery, and spinal surgery. In general, the advantages of 3D-printed parts are said to include reduced surgical time, improved medical outcome, and decreased radiation exposure. The costs of printing and additional scans generally increase the overall cost of the procedure.3D printing is well integrated in surgical practice and research. Applications vary from anatomical models mainly intended for surgical planning to surgical guides and implants. Our research suggests that there are several advantages to 3D-printed applications, but that further research is needed to determine whether the increased intervention costs can be balanced with the observable advantages of this new technology. There is a need for a formal cost-effectiveness analysis.},

We review the basic principles of this technology and provide a comprehensive summary of reported clinical applications in the field.
Standard bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Central Registry for Randomized Trials) were searched from their inception to May 2018 for the terms: "3D printing," "three-dimensional printing," "rapid prototyping," "additive manufacturing," "computer-aided design," "bioprinting," and "biofabrication" in various combinations with the terms: "ptolaryngology," "head and neck surgery," and "otology." Additional articles were identified from the references of retrieved articles. Only studies describing clinical applications of 3D printing were included.
Of 5,532 records identified through database searching, 87 articles were included for qualitative synthesis. Widespread implementation of 3D printing in Oto-HNS is still at its infancy. Nonetheless, it is increasingly being utilized across all subspecialties from preoperative planning to design and fabrication of patient-specific implants and surgical guides. An emerging application considered highly valuable is its use as a teaching tool for medical education and surgical training.As technology and training standards evolve and as healthcare moves toward personalized medicine, 3D printing is emerging as a key technology in patient care in Oto-HNS.

  title = {How useful is 3D printing in maxillofacial surgery?},
  abstract = {3D printing seems to have more and more applications in maxillofacial surgery (MFS), particularly since the release on the market of general use 3D printers several years ago. The aim of our study was to answer 4 questions: 1. Who uses 3D printing in MFS and is it routine or not? 2. What are the main clinical indications for 3D printing in MFS and what are the kinds of objects that are used? 3. Are these objects printed by an official medical device (MD) manufacturer or made directly within the department or the lab? 4. What are the advantages and drawbacks?
Two bibliographic researches were conducted on January the 1st, 2017 in PubMed, without time limitation, using "maxillofacial surgery" AND "3D printing" for the first and for the second "maxillofacial surgery" AND "computer-aided design" AND "computer-aided manufacturing" as keywords. Articles in English or French dealing with human clinical use of 3D printing were selected. Publication date, nationality of the authors, number of patients treated, clinical indication(s), type of printed object(s), type of printing (lab/hospital-made or professional/industry) and advantages/drawbacks were recorded.
Two hundred and ninety-seven articles from 35 countries met the criteria. The most represented country was the People's Republic of China (16% of the articles). A total of 2889 patients (10 per article on average) benefited from 3D printed objects. The most frequent clinical indications were dental implant surgery and mandibular reconstruction. The most frequently printed objects were surgical guides and anatomic models. Forty-five percent of the prints were professional. The main advantages were improvement in precision and reduction of surgical time. The main disadvantages were the cost of the objects and the manufacturing period when printed by the industry.The arrival on the market of low-cost printers has increased the use of 3D printing in MFS. Anatomic models are not considered to be MDs and do not have to follow any regulation. Nowadays, they are easily printed with low-cost printers. They allow for better preoperative planning and training for the procedures and for pre-shaping of plates. Occlusal splints and surgical guides are intended for the smooth transfer of planning to the operating room. They are considered to be MDs and even if they are easy to print, they have to follow the regulations applying to MDs. Patient specific implants (custom-made plates and skeletal reconstruction modules) are much more demanding objects and their manufacturing remains nowadays in the hands of the industry. The main limitation of in-hospital 3D printing is the restrictive regulations applying to MDs. The main limitations of professional 3D printing are the cost and the lead time. 3D printed objects are nowadays easily available in MFS. However, they will never replace a surgeon's skill and should only be considered as useful tools.},

Plaster models of the upper and the lower arch were scanned, as well as the mock-up. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data obtained from cone beam computed tomography were processed through the thresholding procedure. The design of the subperiosteal implant was drawn on the stereolithographic model and scanned. Once the digital project of the subperiosteal implant was completed, it was sent to additive manufacturing. After the surgery, the patient was strictly monitored for up to 2 years. The outcomes were assessed based on the incurrence of biological and mechanical complications, postoperative complications, and implant survival. The patient did not suffer from postoperative complications. Neither biological nor mechanical complications occurred during the follow-up period. At the end of the study, the implant was still in function. Custom-made subperiosteal implants could be considered as an alternative to regenerative procedures for the rehabilitation of severe bone atrophy.

In the present article, the surgical conditions in the war-related head and neck injuries were presented in terms of war surgery with mortality rates.
The study was designed as a retrospective clinical case-control study including primarily 179 head and neck injuries that occurred due to shrapnels in the Syrian Civil War. The records of 2015-2019 years were analyzed according to demographics, injury types, injury location, plastic surgery approaches and postoperative outcomes.
Injury mechanism of all wounds was penetrating type, which was commonly secondary to an explosive device, collapse due to shrapnels of the explosion, gunshot or grenade. While 43(24%) of the wounded were soldiers, 136 (76%) were civilians. Considering the reason for the shrapnel injury, 83% was due to the explosion and 17% was due to gunshot injuries. The 32% showed facial fractures. As the most common fractures of the face were around the maxilla-zygoma (28.4%), orbita (22%), and teeths (18.5%). Considering neck injury zones, region-2 was mostly affected by the region. The third zone had the lowest rate of injury with 10%. In 89 (49%) patients, the authors preferred primary, while 15 gained secondary reconstruction (8%). The authors used Limberg flap for 24 (32%) patients, rotation flap for 39 (52%) patients, and bilobe flap for 12 (16%) patients.The most important cause of mortality was not the destruction, tissue loss caused by shrapnel injury, or experience of the surgeon, but the severe states of sepsis or multiple different trauma when brought for treatment from long range from the war zone.},

The CMF injuries were identified using the "International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification" codes and the data compiled for battlefield injury service members. Nonbattlefield injuries, killed in action, and return to duty cases were excluded.
CMF battlefield injuries were found in 2,014 of the 7,770 battlefield-injured US service members. In the 2,014 injured service members were 4,783 CMF injuries (2.4 injuries per soldier). The incidence of CMF battlefield injuries by branch of service was Army, 72%; Marines, 24%; Navy, 2%; and Air Force, 1%. The incidence of penetrating soft-tissue injuries and fractures was 58% and 27%, respectively. Of the fractures, 76% were open. The location of the facial fractures was the mandible in 36%, maxilla/zygoma in 19%, nasal in 14%, and orbit in 11%. The remaining 20% were not otherwise specified. The primary mechanism of injury involved explosive devices (84%).Of the injured US service members, 26% had injuries to the CMF region in the Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom conflicts during a 6-year period. Multiple penetrating soft-tissue injuries and fractures caused by explosive devices were frequently seen. Increased survivability because of body armor, advanced battlefield medicine, and the increased use of explosive devices is probably related to the elevated incidence of CMF battlefield injuries. The current use of "International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification" codes with the Joint Theater Trauma Registry failed to characterize the severity of facial wounds.},

  abstract = {Improved armor and battlefield medicine have led to better survival in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan than any previous ones. Increased frequency and severity of craniomaxillofacial injuries have been proposed. A comprehensive characterization of the injury pattern sustained during this 10-year period to the craniomaxillofacial region is needed to improve our understanding of these unique injuries, to optimize the treatment for these patients, and to potentially direct strategic development of protective equipment in the future.
The Joint Theater Trauma Registry was queried from October 19, 2001, to March 27, 2011, covering operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom for battle injuries to the craniomaxillofacial region, including patient demographics and mechanism of injury. Injuries were classified according to type (wounds, fractures, burns, vascular injuries, and nerve injuries) using DRG International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev. diagnosis codes.
In this 10-year period, craniomaxillofacial battle injuries to the head and neck were found in 42.2% of patients evacuated out of theater. There is a high preponderance of multiple wounds and open fractures in this region. The primary mechanism of injury involved explosive devices, followed by ballistic trauma.
Modern combat, characterized by blast injuries, results in higher than previously reported incidence of injury to the craniomaxillofacial region.Epidemiologic study, level IV.},

This study aimed to analyze the etiology, pattern, and treatment of MFFs. Epidemiological characteristics and treatment modalities of MFFs have never been evaluated in Somalia. The study included 45 patients who were operated on for MFFs at a tertiary care hospital in Somalia (2018-2019). Patient demographics, fracture causes, types, associated non-facial injuries, treatment modalities, and hospitalization-time were evaluated. The most common etiological factors of the MFFs were explosion (24.4%) and assault (24.4%), followed by gunshot (22.2%), sports accident (15.6%), motor vehicle accident (11.1%), and fall from height (2.2%) patients, respectively. The main site of injury was the mandible bone (64.4%) followed by nasal bone, maxilla, zygomatic, and orbital region. The most common non-facial injuries of the MFFs were soft tissue laceration (37.8%) followed by femoral fracture (6.7%), clavicle fracture (4.4%), and femoral fracture with chest injuries (2.2%). The most applied treatment was open reduction microplate +/- intermaxillary fixation (77.8%). Due to the size of the mandible fractures, an iliac autograft (6.7%) was performed. The mean length of the hospital stay was 11.8 ± 8.4 days (range, 1-45 days), and some patients (15.6%) needed intensive care due to severe injuries. This will be the first study aiming to analyze the etiology, pattern, and treatment of MFFs in Somalia. This study deals with the social aspects of Somalia, and it shows that MFFs develop as a result of highly interpersonal violence in a young man.},

Management challenges begin with lifesaving, which is complicated by airway compromise, severe hemorrhage, and unique injuries of the maxillae, nose, and naso-orbitoethmoid.The patients presented fragment impact on the face lateral side directed to other side leads to tissues blown away at the point of high-energy exits, while no survival seen of enface shrapnel hit directed antroposterior toward "cervical spine, intracranial, internal and external carotid arteries and internal jugular vein."Twenty-two patients were selected from unquantified patients who had sustained massive midface shell fragment injuries. To preserve midface architecture, healing, and function, iodoform paste on ribbon gauze packs were utilized successfully. An iodoform paste on ribbon gauze pack serves the dual purpose of preserving the shape and scaffolding of the crushed maxillary sinus wall and buttresses fragments in position for healing. It also acts as a wet pack dressing for denuded bone fragments, stopping bleeding and having antimicrobial properties for severely lacerated wounds. For total or partial nasal tissue loss, a successful procedure consists of definitive early scaffolding stabilization using an intranasal, modified portex tracheostomy tube stent to preserve the internal shape of the nasal pyramid.},

This article describes immediate management of medial canthal tendon (MCT), intercanthal region and severe nasal war injuries.
The utilized procedure obtained good results compared to the results of cases treated only by applying a classic approach of civilian fractures.Treatments of UCM injuries are the most difficult since UCM includes the esthetic, physiologic, and anatomical regions of the face. The proposed technique provides immediate excellent stability for soft tissues, bone, and cartilage and is well tolerated in the long term by both the tissue and the patient. Most of the times, victims are treated with limited resources, deficient subspecialty, massive injuries, during mass casualties, and a single surgeon must have to handle all these within a short period of time. UCM injuries are really concerning since this region is the core of facial esthetic and function.},

  abstract = {Current weaponry possesses unobserved new, biodynamic wounding effects. For many victims, high velocity, large shell fragments have resulted in massive lower jaw "chopped off" hard and soft tissues injuries accompanied by tongue prolapse. The management challenges begin with lifesaving which is possibly complicated by airway compromise, severe hemorrhage, massive lower jaw loss, and a prolapsed tongue. Consequently, the goal shall be "No patient should die from massive facial tissue injuries alone". That is, if feasible, sensible, lifesaving techniques are applied at the appropriate time. Following general condition stabilization, the surgical management steps of massive lower jaw tissue loss should begin with immediate lost tissue reconstruction. Seventeen cases were selected from an unquantified number patients who had massive mandibular tissue losses in which the tongue, surprisingly, remained intact. In these cases, definitive, early scaffolding stabilization was accomplished by joining the remaining two lower jaw intact segments. The successful procedure consists of using a 2 mm horseshoe shaped Kirschner wire bridging the gap of the mandibular arch which effectively is used as a "scaffold" for rebuilding the soft tissue. Proper, initial, surgical management resulted in protecting lacerated tissue, diminishing subsequent morbidity and disfigurement, preventing a prolapsed tongue and preserving the intact tissues physiological functions. As the spectrum of injuries continues to evolve the clinical characterization of the severity of facial wounds need an expanded classification, appropriate to massive facial injuries. It is suggested it has the following descriptors: blast, penetration, perforation, avulsions and "chopping off" (BPPAC).},

  abstract = {Distinctive mechanisms of primary blast effects have produced a transitional era of facial trauma. Implosion mechanism damage is one of these. Implosion mechanism damage results in injury limited to the gas-containing structures of the auditory canal, paranasal sinuses, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. Worldwide, the victims of explosive detonations have increased and advanced dramatically. The outcome is greater mortality and morbidity and new types of injuries, especially in the maxillofacial region. Thus, the knowledge of, and experience with, their management should be shared globally by colleagues through publications.
The implosion and mini re-explosion of compressed air sinuses leads to skeletal crush injury to the nasal-orbital-ethmoidal, maxillary sinuses, and nasal bones. A variety of surgical approaches were used successfully under conditions of war. The assessment of the associated injuries to the lung and/or brain is the initial priority to any life-threatening blast injury. This article describes the biophysical results of blast injuries to the middle third facial skeleton and associated injuries and details the management and protection of crushed air containing paranasal spaces.
Easy, simple, and fast treatment and management were used successfully on the pulverized, fragmented skeletal architecture of the facial middle part without increasing morbidity and with the avoidance of unnecessary surgical trauma.Injuries in one of the most difficult esthetic, physiologic, and anatomic regions of the body is best treated with an understanding of the biophysical effects of the implosion mechanism on air-containing spaces in the maxillofacial region. The introduction of new methods for the management of severe destruction of hard and soft tissue will decrease the incidence of complications and the operative time.},

Flying debris and high winds commonly cause conventional blunt and penetrating trauma. Injuries caused by blast pressures alone result from complex interactions on living tissues. Interfaces between tissues of different densities or those between tissues and trapped air result in unique patterns of organ damage. These challenge out-of-hospital personnel, emergency physicians, and trauma surgeons to specifically seek evidence of these internal injuries in individuals with multiple trauma, adjust management considerations to avoid exacerbation of life-threatening problems caused by the blast wave itself, and ensure appropriate disposition of these patients in possible mass-casualty situations.

  abstract = {Background/objectives Gunshot injuries are known to cause severe morbidity and mortality when facial regions are involved. Management of the gunshot wounds of the face comprises of securing an airway, controlling hemorrhage, identifying other injuries and definite repair of the traumatic facial deformities. The objective of the present study was to compare the clinical outcome (infection and nonunion) of open reduction and internal fixation versus closed reduction and maxillo-mandibular fixation (CR-MMF) in the treatment of gunshot injuries of the mandible. Materials & methods This study was conducted at Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University/Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences Islamabad, Pakistan. Ninety gunshot mandibular fractures were randomly allocated in two equal groups. In group-A, 45 patients were treated by open reduction and internal fixation while in group-B, 45 patients were also managed by closed reduction and maxillo-mandibular fixation. Post-operative complications (infection, non-union) were evaluated clinically and radiographically in both groups. Results Patients treated by open reduction and internal fixation were having more complications in terms of infection (17.8%) as compared to closed reduction (4.4%) with a p-value 0.044. Whereas non-union was more in closed reduction (15.6%) as compared to open reduction and internal fixation group (2.2%) with a significant p-value 0.026. Conclusion Both the treatment modalities can be used in the management of gunshot injuries of mandible and there is need for further studies to have clear guideline in this regard in best interest of patients, community and health care providers.},

To compare the efficacy of ORIF compared with MMF in achieving bony union of comminuted mandibular fractures in gunshot injury patients.
ology: Randomized controlled trial conducted at the department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for a period of 3 years; total of 40 patients divided equally into two groups. Group A were treated with ORIF and group B were treated with MMF. Callus formation radiographically was confirmed by 8th week post operatively. Data was collected using proforma, entered on a statistical software SPSS version 20. Frequency percentages were computed for age and gender. Chi square and Fisher's exact tests were applied. P value ≤ 0.05 considered significant.
A total of 40 patients of gunshot injuries were included in this study. 37 (92.5%) were males and 3 (7.5%) were Females with mean age of 36.35 ± 12.9 years SD. 19 (47.5%) patients showed callus formation, whereas, 21 (52.5%) did not. Out of 19 patients, 14 (70%) belonged to group A, and 5 (25%) from group B. The final healing considered by 8th week was in 16 (80%) of ORIF group A, and 8 (40%) group B (MMF) after calculating the clinical and radiographic evidences.Comparative clinical trials have proven that ORIF is superior to MMF in the management of comminuted mandibular fractures. Early primary repair and internal fixation provides predictable and cost effective results.},

  abstract = {This report describes the surgical reconstruction of large maxillofacial defect caused by a short-range gunshot injury in a dog using titanium patient-specific implant (PSI). A 3-year-old male Wolf Shepherd was admitted for a large right facial defect with right nasal cavity exposure caused by a gunshot injury. Radiographic examination revealed severe loss of the right maxillary, nasal, and incisive bones, multiple fractures of both left and right palatine bones, and a comminuted fracture of the right mandible. Initial surgical procedure included computed tomography (CT) imaging for three-dimensional (3D) implant design. Open wound management was maintained for 18 days until the fresh granulation tissue fully covered the wound bed. The implant was designed in a "hand grasping shape" to cover the defect, align multiple fractured palatine bones, and make a snap fit function. Multiple holes, including cortical screw holes, were added to the final design. The implant was printed on a titanium alloy. Surgical application of titanium PSI was performed 19 days after the primary surgery. A free sublingual mucosal graft was used to reconstruct the mucosal layer of the right nasal cavity. The mucosa was then covered with collagen membrane to strengthen the structure of the nasal cavity. Blunt dissection of the hard palate mucoperiosteum above the palatine process and palatine bones, soft tissue above the maxilla was performed, and the 3D printed titanium implant was fastened in a preplanned position. The facial soft tissue defect was reconstructed, and the titanium PSI was covered using an angularis oris cutaneous flap. Partial flap necrosis occurred in the rostral aspect, and the wound was managed to heal by a second intension. Flap dehiscence at the junction of the flap and hard palate mucoperiosteum occurred with exposure of the implant 2 days postoperatively. Multiple attempts to close the defect failed, and the owner wanted to stop treatment. Healthy granulated tissue was observed proximal to the implant. The defect no longer increased in size and did not show any noticeable complications related to the defect at 60 days after titanium PSI application, and the dog was discharged. Six months post-operatively, the dog remained active with great appetite, gained weight, and showed acceptable facial symmetry without enlargement of the implant exposure or any implant-related problems.},

A rapid prototyping system was used to 3D-print a three-part template: a helmet to support the others, a starting guide to mark the skin before flap elevation, and a surgical guide for bone drilling. An accuracy evaluation between the planned and the placed final position of each implant was carried out by measuring the inclination of the axis of the implant (angular deviation) and the position of the apex of the implant (deviation at apex).
The implant in the glabella differed in angulation by 7.78°, while the two implants in the premaxilla differed by 1.86 and 4.55°, respectively. The deviation values at the apex of the implants with respect to the planned position were 1.17 mm for the implant in the glabella and 2.81 and 3.39 mm, respectively, for those implanted in the maxilla.The protocol presented in this article may represent a viable way to position craniofacial implants for supporting nasal prostheses.},

Laser-sintering involves zapping layers of powdered metal to recreate a 3D implantable skeletal defect. The process involves using either mirror imaging of the unaffected side or using archival image database of healthy individuals. A 25-year-old man presented with a gunshot injury that left him with a near total avulsed mandible. The patient received state-of-the-art treatment using a laser 3D printed mandible which was connected to the muscles of mastication for functionality. The inner side of the titanium jaw was filled with the patient's comminuted fractured bones in addition to harvested iliac crest bone graft that was covered with the patient's remaining periosteal tissue. The implantation of a near total mandible using 3D laser printing is a fast and predictable process that in selected patients can result in aesthetically as well as functionally excellent results.
